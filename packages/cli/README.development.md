# CLI

## Bundling and Deployment

WIP

Problem 1

`nx run cli:build` puts the files in `<repo-root>/dist/packages/cli/` with entry point `main.js`. I can easily make the file executable with `chmod +x dist/packages/cli/main.js`. The problem is that this file does not have a shebang `#!/usr/bin/env node`. Without the shebang `./dist/packages/cli/main.js help` does not work because the system tries to interpret it as a bash script.

That said, `dist/packages/cli/packages/cli/src/main.js` _does_ have the shebang we define in `packages/cli/src/main.ts:1`.

Question: How to make make turn `dist/packages/cli/main.js` into the correct executable?

Answer: This problem was solved by turning the `cli` project into a _publishable_ library. This way, the `dist` folder stays in the project directory and the shebang is preserved.

Next problem

When publishing the package and installing that package via npm, the package expects any buildable dependencies to be inside `node_modules`. But that is not the case. The obvious workaround is to publish every buildable dependency as well. But that is a bit overkill and leads to overhead on the package-enduser side because installing that one published package requires you to install 20 more tiny packages.

Nx has no good solution for this but [suggests](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/4620#issuecomment-2252879519) to use a different tool than swc or tsc (those are build tools not bundlers; the problem is a bundling issue though). So now I need to switch from tsc to another build/bundle tool...

Answer: Fortunately it was very simple to add esbuild: `nx g @nx/esbuild:configuration cli`.
With that it just worked.

### Why does NX add or not add the `nx-release-publish` target?

This is controlled by `package.json`'s `"private": false` field. If you set it to `true`, the `nx-release-publish` target will not be added.

### Local package registry vs npm

Running `nx run @dungeonmans-mod-tools/root:local-registry` causes NX to set up a local package registry called verdaccio. This is useful for testing the package locally. After you have run The package is published to the local registry with `nx release`. The package is installed from the local registry with `npm install --registry http://localhost:4873 @dungeonmans-mod-tools/cli`.

### Why does nx release not want to publish my package publicly on NPM?

By default nx will try to publish into a private registry on NPM - even if you set `package.json`'s `private: false`. ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

To publish a package publicly you have to explicitly set `publishConfig.access` to `"public"` in the root of `package.json`.

```json
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  }
```

### Why does the cli project set an explicit license in `package.json`?

The explicit license is to please the NPM Gods who do not show the license from the workspace root. There may be an Nx setting somewhere to fix this but I haven't look into it yet.
